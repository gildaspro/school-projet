  	<p><pr>A program is a set of instructions written in a lang uage (such as BASIC) understandable by the computer to perform a particular function on the computer. A well written program could be parceled well to form an application package customized for solving specific type of problem on the computer system.</p><p> A computer programmer is computer scientist (a professional) skilled in using constructs of programming languages to develop executable and acceptable computer programs. A software developer is a programmer. Programmers often work hand in hand with system analysts on large projects.  </p>
  	  <p> 
  	  	Programming languages are artificial notational languages created or developed to be used in preparing coded instructions on the computer for later execution by the computer. They are usually composed of series of usage rules (syntax) that determine the meaning (semantics) of expressions written in the language. Each programming language comes handy with its own translator i.e interpreter or compiler as the case may be.
  	Programming is the art of developing computer programs with the aid of selected programming language by a computer programmer. It is a special skill whose quality is tested by the quality of the resulting program or software.  In programming, programming stages must be properly followed, i.e from problem definition to maintenance and review     </p>
  	<h4>BASIC PROGRAMMING: NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS 
  	</h4>
      <p>
      	BASIC is an acronym for beginnersâ€™ all-purpose symbolic instruction code.BASIC is the name of a high level programming language developed at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire USA under the auspices of professors John G Kemeny and Thomas E. Kutz during their academic years- 1963-64. The language was developed. To teach beginners the basic construct s of programming theory and as much, one of the easiest programming languages to learn. As a high level programming language program code written in written in BASIC must be translated to its equivalence in machine code before it can be executed on the computer. A BASIC interpreter (i.e. translator software) is needed for this purpose. We call the program source code before it translated by the interpreter while the translated version, ready for execution, is called the object code. However, interpreter is not the only translator used in programming. Compilers are used by several other high-level programming languages such as C++, Pascal, etc while assemblers are used by assembly languages. Java has both interpreter and complier Translates the sources code line by line and statement by statement Does not generates an intermediates object  code from the source code and  Translates and executes the sources code simultaneously

      <h5>Merits of BASIC Programming Language 
      </h5>
         <p>BASIC is the simplest programming language BASIC is friendly, easy to teach and to learn compared to other HLL languages It is flexible and easy to code or modify existing code It has simplified grammar (syntax) and relatively fewer number of statements It has a multipurpose language suitable for interactive environments Its interpreter is small and portable It can be programmed on a terminal It is very common and readily available on many micro and mini computers It is the most widely used time sharing language in U.S.A and Canada 
         </p>
       <h6>Demerits of BASIC Programming Language 
       </h6>
          <P>It has slow execution pace, as translation is combined with execution. Many versions of BASIC are unstructured because of statements such as GOTO. Limited portability as different versions requires different interpreter for source code translation. Different Versions of BASIC Programming Language
